This directory contains file `N.m` which contain data of the form `[<I_4, I_2^2>, <I_2*I_4, I_6>, <I_4*I_6, I_10>]`. These are generic formulae for the normalised invariants described in Lemma 2, i.e., where the `I_w` above are the &#8464;<sub>w</sub>(r,s).  All of the data here is taken from Kumar's paper [*Hilbert Modular Surfaces for square discriminants and elliptic subfields of genus 2 function fields*](https://rdcu.be/c1GSr).
