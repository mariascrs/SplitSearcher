Each file `D.m` contains code which outputs a pair of polynomials. In the notation of Lemma 3, these are the polynomials *P<sub>1,2</sub>* and *P<sub>2,3</sub>*. Since some of these files are very large, all `alpha_1, alpha_2, alpha_3` are replaced with `i1, i2, i3` in the name of space.

We do not include *N = 97, 100, 121* due to size constraints.
