This directory contains file `D.m` which contain data of the form `[<I_4, I_2^2>, <I_2*I_4, I_6>, <I_4*I_6, I_10>]`. These are generic formulae for the normalised invariants described in Lemma 2, i.e., where the `I_w` above are the &#8464;<sub>w</sub>(r,s).  All of the data here is taken from Elkies and Kumar's paper [*K3 surfaces and equations for Hilbert modular surfaces*](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/algebra-and-number-theory/volume-8/issue-10/K3-surfaces-and-equations-for-Hilbert-modular-surfaces/10.2140/ant.2014.8.2297.full).
