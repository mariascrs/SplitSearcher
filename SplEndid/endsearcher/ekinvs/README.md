Each file `D.m` contains code which outputs the Igusa--Clebsch invariants associated to a generic genus 2 curve that has RM D, as given in Elkies and Kumar's paper [*K3 surfaces and equations for Hilbert modular surfaces*](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/algebra-and-number-theory/volume-8/issue-10/K3-surfaces-and-equations-for-Hilbert-modular-surfaces/10.2140/ant.2014.8.2297.full).
