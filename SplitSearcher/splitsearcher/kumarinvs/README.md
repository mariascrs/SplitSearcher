Each file `N.m` contains code which outputs the Igusa--Clebsch invariants associated to a generic genus 2 curve that is (N,N)-split, as given in Kumar's paper [*Hilbert Modular Surfaces for square discriminants and elliptic subfields of genus 2 function fields*](https://rdcu.be/c1GSr).

Note that the roles of r, s have been swapped when N = 2, 6 and 11, as described in Footnote 9.
