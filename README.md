This repository contains the code which is attached to [*An algorithm for efficient detection of (N,N)-splittings and its application to the isogeny problem in dimension 2*](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1736), and the extended version of this paper entitled *Efficient algorithms for the detection of (N,N)-splittings and endomorphisms*, by Maria Corte-Real Santos, Craig Costello, and Sam Frengley. All of the code in this repository was written in [`Magma`](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/). 

There are three directories:

- `SplitSearcher`: contains the code required to run SplitSearcher, as described in Section 5 and 6 of the (original and extended version of the) paper.

- `SplEndid`: contains the code required to run SplEndid, as described in Section 7 of the extended version of the paper

- `verification`: contains code that verifies claims in the paper.
