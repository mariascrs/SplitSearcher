This repository contains the code which is attached to [*An algorithm for efficient detection of (N,N)-splittings and its application to the isogeny problem in dimension 2*](link) by Maria Corte-Real Santos, Craig Costello, and Sam Frengley. All of the code in this repository was written in [`Magma`](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/). 

There are two directories:

- `code`: contains the code required to run the algorithms described in the paper.

- `verification`: contains code that verifies claims in the paper.
